        <p>Hi! My name is Aidan Burton and I'm from Oregon. I enjoy playing video games, going hiking, and riding ATVs. I've just begun a serious interest in sports bikes and am working towards my first bike.
            <br>I am excited to begin learning front end/back end development and looking forward to making some friends along the way.
